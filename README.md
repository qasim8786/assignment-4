# Assignment â€“ File Handling in Python

This repo includes two Python scripts focused on basic file operations and error handling.

## Task 1: Read File with Error Handling
- Tries to open and read `sample.txt`.
- Prints content line by line.
- Shows a friendly message if the file doesn't exist.

## Task 2: Write and Append to File
- Takes input from the user.
- Writes and appends it to `output.txt`.
- Reads and prints the final file content.
